Thanks for downloading the OpenAMD Project web interface!

A few install tips:

-Right now, the system requires Oracle. This requires several things.

Refer to this page for instructions on how to install oci8 with PHP:
http://us.php.net/manual/en/oci8.setup.php

Modify the file config.php with the credentials and paths to your server
and web services.

-We were using direct queries instead of stored procedures, basically 
so we could get things finished in time. All of the queries should be 
wrapped under "oracle_query", a basic wrapper we created because mdb2 sucked
and we needed something fast. These queries are written for Oracle, so if
you want to use this with another db, modify the queries accordingly.

-There is a copy of the database schema we used, create-hopeamd.sql. 

-If you have any issues installing, please email contribute@openamd.org.

Thanks,
