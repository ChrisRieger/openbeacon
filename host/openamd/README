Greets all. Thanks for downloading the OpenAMD web interface, v0.1.

A few notes:

1- There really isn't an installer file or anything. At the moment,
   you need to have a system running PHP5 on it, connecting to an 
   Oracle database. Consult the installer file for more info.

2- We will be making a lot of changes (bug fixes, new features, etc)
   to this system as time passes. We encourage outside contributions,
   but would really prefer you check out the latest build before 
   sending patches.

3- If you are interested in using this software (or the Openbeacon
   hardware) for your own conference, let us know. While it is open
   source, we are more than happy to set up an installation for you.

Past that, this is your data, so we're giving it back to you. Enjoy, 
have fun, and please contribute with any cool ideas you can have!
Stay tuned to http://amd.hope.net for any updates.

Thanks,
The OpenAMD Team
