2009-06-21 22:21  henryk

	* openbeacon-openpicc2/application/dosfs/sdcard.c: Even further
	  increase the bus speed (and correspondingly increase timeout
	  counters).
	  This brings the speed up to 1.77 MB/s (56% increase) but may be

2009-06-21 11:04  henryk

	* openbeacon-openpicc2/application/dosfs/dosfs.c: Enhance the

	  performance increase.

2009-06-21 10:49  henryk

2009-06-20 11:07  henryk

	* openbeacon-openpicc2/application/dosfs/sdcard.c: Make
	  sdcard_claim()/_release() nestable and bracket DFS_ReadSector()
	  with a claim/release pair. This means that the SPI will only be
	  put into bus exclusive once per call to DFS_ReadSector()
	  Obviously this will only really bring benefits when
	  DFS_ReadSector() is called with a count > 1. Preliminary results
	  show a speed-up of up to 10%

2009-06-19 21:21  henryk

	* openbeacon-openpicc2/application/dosfs/sdcard.c: Aggressively
	  optimize the sdcard reading: decrease the clock divisor (to 4,
	  leading to a SPI clock rate of about 11.98 megahertz) and
	  increase the cutoff for blocking mode (thereby basically
	  eliminating the background mode calls). This brings the sdcard
	  read speed up to 0.54 megabytes per second, but beware that this
	  is potentially unsafe, leading to watchdog resets

	  Fix spi_transceive for the bus_exclusive case (should reject new

	  Convert sdcard code to use the blocking mode for short transfers,
	  brings sdcard read speed to about 0.29 MB/s (up from 0.22 MB/s)

	* openbeacon-openpicc2/application/paint/paint.c: Add a kludgy hack
