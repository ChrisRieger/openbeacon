2009-07-10 17:20  henryk

	* [r542] openbeacon-openpicc2/Makefile: Regression: spi.c can only

	  Makefile to earlier workaround while I'm looking for a proper fix

2009-07-02 23:52  henryk

	* [r540] openbeacon-openpicc2/application/paint/paint.c: Fix last

2009-07-02 17:00  henryk

	* [r538] openbeacon-openpicc2/application/eink/eink.c: Let the eInk
	  controller know that its SDRAM is actually 32MB and not 16MB

2009-06-28 21:48  henryk

	* [r537] openbeacon-openpicc2/Makefile,
	  openbeacon-openpicc2/application/spi.c: Work around the internal
	  compiler error. For some reason "&xTaskWoken" leads to an
	  internal compiler error, unless xTaskWoken is global or static

2009-06-23 11:53  henryk

	* [r536] openbeacon-openpicc2/application/image/image.c,
	  openbeacon-openpicc2/application/image/image.h,

	  access

2009-06-23 11:48  henryk

	* [r534] openbeacon-openpicc2/application/dosfs/fat_helper.c,
	  openbeacon-openpicc2/application/dosfs/fat_helper.h: Add
	  fat_helper_open

2009-06-23 11:46  henryk

	* [r533] openbeacon-openpicc2/application/dosfs/sdcard.c: Undo
	  r526, not worth the trouble.
	  Also reduce sdcard bus speed, doesn't seem stable

2009-06-23 00:59  henryk

	* [r532] openbeacon-openpicc2/application/image/image.h: Forgotten
	  prototypes

2009-06-23 00:58  henryk

	* [r531] openbeacon-openpicc2/application/image/image.c: Add
	  functions to allocate images from malloc (not used currently

2009-06-22 14:23  henryk

	* [r530] openbeacon-openpicc2/application/nfc/picc_emu.c: Ignore
	  empty lines

	  enhancement to non-SRAM areas

2009-06-22 09:56  henryk

	* [r527] openbeacon-openpicc2/application/dosfs/sdcard.c: bla

2009-06-22 09:39  henryk

	* [r526] openbeacon-openpicc2/application/dosfs/sdcard.c: Small
	  performance increase (about 2%, now at 1.81 MB/s)

2009-06-21 22:21  henryk

	* [r525] openbeacon-openpicc2/application/dosfs/sdcard.c: Even
	  further increase the bus speed (and correspondingly increase
	  timeout counters).
	  This brings the speed up to 1.77 MB/s (56% increase) but may be
	  even more unreliable (the spec says we're still in the clear,
	  though).

2009-06-21 11:08  henryk

	* [r524] openbeacon-openpicc2/application/dosfs/dosfs.c: Add note
	  about possible tweaking. Probably not worth the effort to
	  properly investigate.

2009-06-21 11:04  henryk

	* [r523] openbeacon-openpicc2/application/dosfs/dosfs.c: Enhance
	  the multi-sector optimization to also apply for reads longer than
	  two sectors but shorter than the complete cluster. Less than 1%
	  performance increase.

2009-06-21 10:49  henryk

	* [r522] openbeacon-openpicc2/application/dosfs/dosfs.c: Properly
	  maintain the FAT cache, 3% performance increase (now 1.12 MB/s)

2009-06-20 20:57  henryk

	* [r521] openbeacon-openpicc2/application/dosfs/sdcard.c: Properly
	  implement READ_MULTIPLE_BLOCK in sdcard_disk_read(). HUGE
	  performance increase, now at 1.09 MB/s.

2009-06-20 20:56  henryk

	* [r520] openbeacon-openpicc2/application/spi.c,
	  openbeacon-openpicc2/application/spi.h: Add
	  spi_force_transmit_pin()/spi_release_transmit_pin() to be used in
	  bus exclusive mode to force the MOSI pin to a specific logic
	  level regardless of the transmitted data values in transceive

2009-06-20 17:10  henryk

	* [r519] openbeacon-openpicc2/application/dosfs/dosfs.c: Implement
	  multi-sector read optimiziation within a cluster, brings another
	  ten or so percent; speed is now 0.598 MB/s

2009-06-20 11:17  henryk

	* [r518] openbeacon-openpicc2/application/dosfs/sdcard.c: Optimize
	  CRC discard, slight performance increase (2%)

2009-06-20 11:07  henryk

	* [r517] openbeacon-openpicc2/application/dosfs/sdcard.c: Make
	  sdcard_claim()/_release() nestable and bracket DFS_ReadSector()
	  with a claim/release pair. This means that the SPI will only be
	  put into bus exclusive once per call to DFS_ReadSector()
	  Obviously this will only really bring benefits when
	  DFS_ReadSector() is called with a count > 1. Preliminary results
	  show a speed-up of up to 10%

2009-06-19 21:21  henryk

	* [r516] openbeacon-openpicc2/application/dosfs/sdcard.c:
	  Aggressively optimize the sdcard reading: decrease the clock
	  divisor (to 4, leading to a SPI clock rate of about 11.98
	  megahertz) and increase the cutoff for blocking mode (thereby
	  basically
	  eliminating the background mode calls). This brings the sdcard
	  read speed up to 0.54 megabytes per second, but beware that this
	  is potentially unsafe, leading to watchdog resets

	  Fix spi_transceive for the bus_exclusive case (should reject new
	  jobs until the bus is free again)
	  Convert sdcard code to use the blocking mode for short transfers,
	  brings sdcard read speed to about 0.29 MB/s (up from 0.22 MB/s)
	  Fix sdcard.[ch] indentation
